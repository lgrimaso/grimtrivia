A police officer asked what had happened and the man explained that when they were walking along the cliffs of the shore, he heard a big roll of thunder come out of nowhere. No further thunder washeard after the first one. He turned around startled to see what happened and then a huge bolt of lightning struck and he heard his wife scream. He turned around and saw his wife lying mangled on the sharp rocks at the bottom of the cliff, and he saw a man running away. Can the mans story be true?</p>
