                <h2>This 1986 movie was referred to by Leonard Maltin as a hopeless mess of a movie. In fact the guy inside the animal is also the voice of Chucky from the Childs Play series. Siskel  Ebert called it the Worst Film of 1986. It won 4 Razzies for  Picture, New Star, Visual Effects, and Screenplay.</p>

                <h2>This film grossed $1.6 million and it was so gross that parents lobbied to have it removed from circulation and it was. Not only did it get a 0% rating from Rotten Tomatoes but a critic said that it was too repulsive for children or adults of any age. It was a very crude parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids.</p>

                <h2>This 1988 sci-fi film received 0% from Rotten Tomatoes and critical remarks like more like a TV commercial than a movie (referring to constant reminders of Coca-Cola and McDonalds) and Quite possibly one of the worst movies of the past 435 years. It was trying to cash in on the success of E.T. but ended up being a shameless knockoff. Ronald McDonald received a Razzie for Worst New Star.</p>

                <h2>This 1962 films full title adds The Name Written in Blood. Our hero, a pre-historic caveman, falls in love with a gal from the 1960s. This sounds a little bit like Blast from the Past where a man emerges from a bomb shelter after 35 years. The budget for the film was an astounding $15,000 but it grossed only $3000. Luckily the hapless caveman fared better as the steel-toothed Jaws who appeared in some of the James Bond movies.</p>
